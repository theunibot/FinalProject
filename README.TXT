This project is call "theunibot", by Unidesk Corporation.

The primary use of the software is to control the ST Robotics R12 robot to demonstrate how
the Unidesk software product can simplify managing desktops.   The robot is used at trade shows
and other public events to draw attention to the concepts of Unidesk.

This software is divided into two key parts: the R12 controller server (written in Java) and the
HTML5 user interface (written in Adobe Edge Animate / Javascript).  The R12 controller uses a REST
API to provide command to control the R12 system.
