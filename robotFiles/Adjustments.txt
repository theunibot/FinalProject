// This file defines all adjustments for all known positions of each shelf
//
// This file defines minor adjustments, in millimeters, to the positions
// contained in the Positions.txt file.  It can be edited by hand, or is also
// updated by commands from within the software.  This provides for tuning and
// calibration of the surface without having to adust the primary coordinate
// file.  Additionally, adjustments can be made on-the-fly while the software
// is operational.  The syntax is basically the same as the Positions.txt file,
// except that each line defines the relative offset, rather than the absolute
// position.
